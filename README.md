# GifinatorSite

{== The General Purpose==}

  The Giffinator site will allow you to search giphy for topics of your choice. A search for a topic will display the 10 most relevant 
images to that topic along with a rating and the title.

[--- How To Navigate ---]

  You may start by clicking on one of the pre-assigned topic buttons to generate a list of gifs. Scroll down to see them all!
  But where the real magic happens is when you input your own topic into the input field and click submit. You can generate 
  as many custom topic buttons as you like. You may search to your hearts content!
